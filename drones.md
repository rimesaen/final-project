# DRONE RECORDS

Last Update: 24 February 2026

## Light signals

- M3 blue blinks when charging.
- M4 red/green indicates radio communication.

## #1: Nothing

> Flow and Multiranger equipped.

24/2: Still alive!! Capable of wall-following. Efficiency debatable. Really likes to spin.
26/2: Took Nothing out on another wall-following run. Successful!(?) It seems like there is a problem with the algorithm that causes the drones to struggle when the space around it is too little. When Nothing was moved out of the little box and into the bigger outer room, it followed one of the walls pretty alright (there's a video of it! Somewhere!).

## #2: Something

> AI deck equipped.

24/2: Unresponsive. No longer charges. Something has officially broken. :(
25/2.1: REVIVAL SUCCESSFUL!! Attempting to install AI deck on this one; will be removing other decks for the time being.
25/2.2: AI deck not successfully installed; the Wi-Fi connection couldn't be connected, and the access point couldn't be accessed. Unsure of reasons why.

## #3: Anything

> AI equipped.

24/2: Thanks to their sacrifice, we managed to figure out how to assemble three decks onto the drone. Whether or not the decks all work: unconfirmed.
25/2: Dying on us. AI deck does not appear to be updating correctly; very likely a problem with the deck. Might have to use the GAP8 bootloader.

## #4: Everything

> Unbuilt.

## #5: A Thing

> Unbuilt.

## #6: The Thing

> Unbuilt.
