## #1: Nothing

> Flow and Multiranger equipped.

24/2: Still alive!! Capable of wall-following. Efficiency debatable. Really likes to spin.

## #2: Something

> Flow and Multiranger equipped.

24/2: Unresponsive. No longer charges. Something has officially broken. :(
25/2: REVIVAL SUCCESSFUL!! Attempting to install AI deck on this one; will be removing other decks for the time being.

## #3: Anything

> AI equipped.

24/2: Thanks to their sacrifice, we managed to figure out how to assemble three decks onto the drone. Whether or not the decks all work: unconfirmed.
25/2: Dying on us. AI deck does not appear to be updating correctly; very likely a problem with the deck. Might have to use the GAP8 bootloader.

## #4: Everything

> Unbuilt.

## #5: A Thing

> Unbuilt.

## #6: The Thing

> Unbuilt.
